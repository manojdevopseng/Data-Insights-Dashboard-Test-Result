# Automated Test Suite with AWS ECS Deployment

Welcome to the Automated Test Suite repository with AWS ECS Deployment. This project contains an automated test suite for a web application using Selenium and a Python-based API testing framework. Additionally, it provides instructions on deploying the tests to AWS ECS.

## Description

This repository houses an automated test suite that combines web application testing with Selenium and API testing using Python. The test suite validates the functionality of a web application and its API endpoints. It also demonstrates how to send test logs and screenshots via email using AWS SES and save browser logs to AWS S3.

## How to Build

Follow these steps to build and execute the automated test suite locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure that you have Chrome WebDriver installed.

4. Set up your AWS credentials in your environment if required for log and screenshot uploads.

5. Execute the test suite using the following command:
   ```bash
   python latestpythontestscript.py

How to Deploy on AWS ECS
To deploy the test suite on AWS ECS, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI and Terraform installed.

2. Configure your AWS credentials and set up your AWS environment.

3. Modify the Terraform configuration in ecs.tf to meet your specific requirements.

4. Initialize the Terraform workspace:
  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```
5. Create the ECS cluster and task definition using Terraform:
  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```
6. Set up an ECS service and, if needed, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for deployment.
